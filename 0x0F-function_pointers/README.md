0x0F. C - Function pointers

A pointer to a function.

0. Write a function that prints a name.

1. Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

2. Write a function that searches for an integer.

3. Write a program that performs simple operations
	This task requires that you create four different files.
	1-the file that contains all the function prototypes and data structures used by the program.
	2-the file that  contain the function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user
	3-the file that contain your main function only.
	4-the file that contain the 5 following functions (not more):

		op add: returns the sum of a and b. Prototype: int op add(int a, int b);
		op sub: returns the difference of a and b. Prototype: int op sub(int a, int b);
		op mul: returns the product of a and b. Prototype: int op mul(int a, int b);
		op div: returns the result of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op div(int a, int b);
		op mod: returns the remainder of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op mod(int a, int b);
